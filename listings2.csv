Despite its modern commercial expansion, the area is home to several ancient Roman ruins and evidence of settlements even earlier, making Hospitalet de Llobregat one of Catalonia’s oldest neighbourhoods.

- Provide the owner a full service under which you can forget about the worries and concerns the operation of holiday rental, knowing that the investment in the business will bring greater benefits than the option of ""traditional"" rent.
- Get the highest customer satisfaction, ensuring their comfort, in order to make your stay in our apartments result in all the most pleasant time possible.

Our differences with other organizations dedicated to the tourist apartment sector lies in providing special pampering to the customer, feeling to be at their own home and have at all the time a ""friend"" of reference in the city. This person (me or some of my collaborators) speaks your language, and will help you to solve any questions or problems and looking for suggestions of leisure in the city. 
All this expertise  has allowed us to grow gradually, as the viral marketing has proven to be our best advertising tool, and thus many customers and many others have repeated recommend us to their family and friends.

Three listings are actually only one holiday house that we own, but during the Film Festival in Locarno I only rent two rooms and I make breakfast because then we always have very good conversations under the kaki tree. Our own accommodations are not so perfect and therefore I try to describe them very well, hoping that sophisticated people won't even consider staying with us. 

Airbnb says it is not a hotel, but I always get messages trying to encourage me for instant booking. I think that instant booking should be something exclusively for hotels.

He later excelled in windsurfing, taking part in amateur and professional competition in Aruba and in Spain, where he took 10th place in the overall PWA Spain ranking in 1996.
 
Recreational boating came at a later stage after he got his Spanish boating license, by renting sailboats to the Balearics every summer and enjoying his own speedboat along the Costa Brava.
 
Due to his passion for boats a close friend convinced him to get his yachting certifications and give the yachting Industry a try.
 
One week after, he was working on the brand new 78m Superyacht “TITAN” in the MB92 yard in Barcelona, and other yachts followed like 94m “MAYAN QUEEN”, LUNA itself and shortly after came a contract to work in Monaco as crew on the 66m Motor Yacht “WEDGE TOO”, spending a winter in Monte Carlo.
 
His non-yacht-related experience was always indirectly very much related to it as well, having worked as a Sales and Marketing Manager for Helly Hansen (Sportswear, Workwear and Survival Suits) in Spain for over 10 years, and for brands like Quiksilver, Neil Pryde, and his very own distribution company selling Kinetic Sailboards®.

You could easily spend the day just popping in-and-out of the various artist galleries, small boutiques and neighbourhood cafes scattered about, that is if you can tear yourself away from the high-end shops that line the avenues.

I love travelling in South America, especially in Uruguay. Most of my family lives there. The beaches are incredible, and the food is out of the world.  

I cannot live without eating that is the least to say and I cook a lot but London has the best places to eat... ask me if you need advise!  we are lucky in London for that  ... And I cannot live without going to pineapple dance studio in London, they have some great classes too - you can learn anything  ... Bollywood dances and Flamenco for instance. 

I got this place last year, and I am sad I cannot live in it as much as I want to- this is why I want others to get the chance! 

Best,

Tania

You'll want to see all the main sights like Buckingham Palace, the houses of parliament, the Tate galleries and Big Ben but if you really want to experience London, then there's nothing better than staying with a local. I'm a big foodie, as are many of my friends, and London's cafes and restaurants are some of the best in the world. I'm a bit of a culture vulture and to me that means everything from local markets to galleries, small music venues and pop up shops. I like the quirky, the revealing as well as the traditional.   I have a sense of humour, enjoy good conversation and plenty of laughs.

I have to point this out, because it is just happening to many times this year!

Please it is you the guest's responsibility to keep me ,updated about your arrival times and any delays and any changes in your travels.
It is showing courtesy.

Also...
I am afraid I can not accept bookings from people who have no information on their profile. 

I  also can not accept bookings from people who have not given proper identification to Airbnb.

Phone number or email address does not qualify as proper identification!

If you book a room in a hotel, you have to give your identification for security reasons, well the same here.

Thank you.

So social distance is no problem  if needed.
As your and my safety is my priority as ever before!
Looking forward to be your host again...

Please have a profile photo of yourself and make sure you are verified with proper ID with airbnb, or sadly I will not be able to accept. 

This is for my own security and peace of mind...
So please do the same...thanks.

My flat is in a residential apartment building, what is a very quiet residence.
My flat is near Regents Park what is only a five  minute walk from my place. There are 3 tube stations near by and 3 bus stops with 6 different routes within a 5-8 minute walk from the flat that will take you to the centre of town within 10-15 min or out of town. My flat is a 20 min walk from the West End. I work part-time from home and part-time at the studio as a 3D model maker and lamp designer. 
I am quiet and respectful to your privacy.
I will interact with you as much or how less you want me too. 
 I love travelling, I am an ECO traveller!  For sure camping into the wild, I adore nature and respect it with all my heart. I love and do mountain biking, hiking, diving, rock-climbing ,love cooking and having a glass of wine with some good cheese with my friends and enjoy a good conversation.

About what Jimmy ( James),  forgot to mention in his review.
after AIRBNB warned him that his behaviour was unacceptable!
He brought a prostitute into my home!
Jeopardising security and privacy. 
He also upset neighbours with coming home every morning 4 am and banging doors.
James did not read my profile, then he would have noticed that this is an residential building and if you are planning to stay out untill the early hours then my place is NOT the right place for you to stay.

So to all future guests, if you do something like that, I will ask you to leave ASAP!

Thank you for reading my profile. 

I am looking forward hearing from you:)

I am Talat and I live with my wife Nalan and 12 years old son Robin. Our house is spacious and well located for transport within London as well as the most of the airports apart from Gatwick...
We all love travelling and meeting new people. We traveled in Europe extensively and also visited some countries in Asia and Central America. English, French and Turkish are the main languages spoken in our household but we can communicate in basic Spanish and German. 
I often play basketball with Robin and take him to a nearby water reservoir for sailing and kayaking which he likes very much.

I am endlessly curious. I love to experience the world with eyes wide open. I never stop exploring, discovering and evolving.

Likewise, I love Science, the Arts, and creative people. Life to me is a storybook full of fascinating tales. I amass information 'on the hoof' and very little passes me by. Understanding what makes others tick is meat and drink to me and proves to be a source of endless joy.

I always keep my mind active. I love beauty in all forms, I am well-educated, and I like to remain totally classless. This makes it easy for me to get on with just about any sort of person. I am thought-provoking and even quite deep on occasions. I also get involved in other exciting things which keep me busy too, such as painting, reading books, newspaper and cultural magazines, photography, video editing, cycling, theatre, music, and movies.

Furthermore, I strongly believe a very clean, secure, welcoming feel, and comfortable apartment is of paramount importance for travellers.

My life's golden rule is to treat others as you wish to be treated!

I am always on an adventure. Enjoy hearing about people's travels and lifestyles.

You may want to know that I am a very responsive host, so if you encounter any issues while staying in my properties, I very much appreciate you to address them straight away and give me the chance to fix them.

WHY WILLIAMSBURG?

Williamsburg is FABULOUS. It's fast growing and it's fast changing. It's hip. In the 1960's the new and exciting place where culture was blooming was Greenwich Village. In the 70's the SOHO neighborhood was where cheap industrial loft space were being turned into places where the adventurous could move to New York, live cheaply and make the new art, music, and culture. These days Williamsburg has that special chemistry of the New York that's constantly renewing itself.

We are a well traveled family having visited several countries on every continent except Australia (next stop :)). Idriys is studying Spanish and Mandarin in school , and I am picking up a bit of each myself. We adopted our pup Chester in May 2015. He is a sweet dog who loves people and animals. He is very well-behaved and gives us and our guests love but also space. He's very cool, no begging or barking and very well-mannered. The perfect dog for us! In addition to travel we love good food, art, good people, and hosting! What started out as a financial endeavor has turned out to be so much more. Through this business, we have met the loveliest people from all over the world many of whom have become people we truly consider friends. Its not unusual that our guests wind up inviting us to see a show, share a meal, or to explore the city with them. What a wonderful way to make a living by providing a peaceful environment, good energy, and a home away from home to people during their travels. We hope to do the same for you!",within a day,100%,50%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0a4088d9-9c25-421a-808f-2921f1668300.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0a4088d9-9c25-421a-808f-2921f1668300.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Clinton Hill,2,5,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Clinton Hill,Brooklyn,40.68513,-73.96648,Private room in condo,Private room,5,,1.5 baths,1,3,"[""Stove"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""TV with standard cable"", ""Essentials"", ""Backyard"", ""BBQ grill"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Hot water"", ""Heating"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Free street parking"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Pack \u2019n play/Travel crib"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Bathtub"", ""Cable TV"", ""Bed linens"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Hangers"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""EV charger"", ""Iron"", ""Shampoo"", ""Kitchen"", ""Shower gel"", ""Children\u2019s books and toys"", ""Wifi""]",$171.00 ,30,365,30,30,365,365,30,365,,t,29,59,89,364,9/7/2022,13,0,0,7/15/2011,12/10/2019,5,4.82,4.82,4.82,5,4.91,4.73,,f,2,0,2,0,0.1,New York

I'm in Marketing and I travel a lot for work. 

I've been living in New York for many years, but am always in awe when go, for instance to Times Square. To simply stand there, looking at those billboards, lights... I always try to count how many ""televisions"" there are but I always loose count... There are whole buildings that are televisions.. It's just fascinating!

For the more relaxed times I *love* my charming neighborhood... In the Lower East Side (LES) things are calmer... There are tree-lined, European-like narrow streets, lovely coffee-shops, restaurants with tables on the streets... bars with live music... lots of green gardens, flowers, families with kids, hip, young professionals, and *lots* of amazing little places, restaurants, bakeries, boutiques, theaters, cinemas. That's why I chose to live here. 

It's a super-super safe, area, even late at night, I'm totally comfortable waking around at 2 or 3am - it's very intellectual, bohemian and artistic. 

It's one of the most ""happening"" neighborhoods, 
as well as SOHO and the Meatpacking. 

Everyone loves the Lower East Side - take a look at my reviews. 
If you come to visit you'll see what I mean! :-)

After Airbnb contacted Ryan to remove his guest, Ryan then opened up the lines of communications instantly! Stating that, ""His past experiences with Airbnb and having had guest staying for a few days with him before has never been an issue."" Of cause it's never been an issue before with Ryan because he was never caught!!! Communication isn't key with Ryan! Apparently mentioning to the host that other guest will be joining him isn't in Ryan's radar to communicate!

We have been offering our properties since 2010 in NYC and since 2013 in Washington DC. I manage the property in DC for my big sister, Khadijah, who is an attorney and interior designer. She lives in the attached house there. While I will handle all of your arrangements beforehand, I am based in NYC. Upon arrival, Khadijah will be your host in Washington DC.

In NYC, you will meet me, Idriys, and Chester. I am an actor/writer/director who is now beginning to study music. My son, Idriys, is my favorite thing. He loves art, sports, literature and music and is extremely good with small children (and animals) if you ever need a babysitter. We are a well traveled family having visited several countries on every continent except Australia (next stop :)). Idriys is studying Spanish and Mandarin in school , and I am picking up a bit of each myself. We adopted our pup Chester in May 2015. He is a sweet dog who loves people and animals. He is very well-behaved and gives us and our guests love but also space. He's very cool, no begging or barking and very well-mannered. The perfect dog for us! In addition to travel we love good food, art, good people, and hosting! What started out as a financial endeavor has turned out to be so much more. Through this business, we have met the loveliest people from all over the world many of whom have become people we truly consider friends. Its not unusual that our guests wind up inviting us to see a show, share a meal, or to explore the city with them.

My name is Janara Morenna. I’m doing Airbnb as pioneer since the beginning in Brazil, 2011. Superhost consecutive times as result of the pleasure to receive people, offer the best experiencies and tips as a local “Carioca”. 

You can also find my business searching for  “Hosting Rio”  .
Is also easy to find at insta  @hostingrio or @dra.Janara to follow my tips and recommendations (restaurantes, bars etc.)

I’m designer/marketer, living in Leblon, also researcher doctorate with my PhD’s in “beach culture of Rio”. For me is a pleasure mix the reception with my knowledge of culture. 

Services plus VIP GUEST:
I like to be a host in a very artisanal way, to receive the guest “face by face”, to show the house, I also give my personal number and connect with my partners for personal chef, fashion services, vip personal concierge, helicopter trips, boat services, beauty saloons etc.  

For me, quality comes before quantity, I like to have only what I can manage with a quick response and taking care about my guests. 

Best wishes

I am an American married to a Brazilian and we have a multiculti daughter.  We live part of the time in Rio de Janeiro Brazil and part in La Jolla California.   Then the rest of the time we love to travel!

I first came to Rio in 2003 for work in the Fashion industry.  It just so happened my now husband was my then agent.  He showed me the local style of Rio and I instantly feel in love.  Well, at first with the City and the country and later him. : )  

 Andre, is a huge water guy, he surfs- stand-up, Kite and short board.  He is a triathlete.  Needless to say we spend most of our time outside, at the beach or around the beach life style.  I on the other hand, love Yoga, meditation, cooking, gardening, a good book, dance, good wine, fashion, interior design and most of all travel! 

We are fortunate to be a family that travels internationally many times each year.  My daughter is bilingual and working on her third language, (mandrin).  

In one of my many past careers I was a professional Dancer and had the good fortune of working for a famous band.  I traveled all over the world for 5 years.  It was a special time and an honer and a pleasure to have the experience of knowing so many incredible placed and people.  It would be very hard to pick one but I must say the Magical Island of Bali is my all time favorite.  

We hope to see you here in Rio Soon

In 2011 we spent 2 weeks in Paris in a rented apartment. We loved the experience because it was cozy, it was charming, it made us feel like we were one of the locals and it was also cheaper than a hotel.

 WHY CHOOSE BOTAFOGO ?

Rio has several neighborhoods. The best five includes Botafogo. More youngish  than Ipanema. Better value for money compares to Leblon. No so crowded as Copacabana.
.
Botafogo is compared to Local’s East Village ( N.Y). Imagine a charming, completely local, miscellaneous stores (  The biggest mall, high bakeries, premium and cheap supermarkets,  young bars, amazing-closed public garden, banks and juicy local’s stores. Don’t waste your time. Booking now!

_________________
KEEP IN MIND.

Rio is not ready for an international big event or foreigner experience. The city is most Portuguese informed. Choosing a polyglot Senior Host guarantees you always be safe in the city. Sometimes, you’ll have a cheaper place, but no value for money.  Think about that.

I’m sucker for sunsets (if you’re lucky on some days, you can see beautiful sunset from my balcony), the stars, good coffee & music, road trips, clear blue sea and fine sushis. I've traveled quite a bit mostly around Asia. I prefer the road less taken, wandering around the streets because the journey is more important than the destination. My yearly resolution is to travel to a country that I've not been before. Happy to say that I am on track, visited 30 countries over 140 cities to date. I hope I am able to share my adventures with you likewise to see the world through you. Airbnb definitely helps us to fulfilled this dream of US!

We love to have you here while you are in Singapore.

Read my reviews and when you get here, ask for the guest book, you will get to know heaps of great friends across the globe! 

Also - Finally being an Airbnb host since 2011, we obtained our Hotel License to legally operate in Singapore for short term stays!

We would like to take this opportunity to appreciate all our faithful long term guests who have stayed and support us during all these years.  Please come back to experience our the new K2 Guesthouse at South Buona Vista.

This is a new AirBnB account, although I have been using the website for a while and have enjoyed staying in many places around the world, as well as hosting many great guests.
From here in Singapore I have had the pleasure of visiting other great destinations in Asia such as Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. 
My hobbies include travel, playing guitar, catching up with friends, skateboarding, live music shows and nerdy things like maths and chess. 
Upon greeting my guests I give them resources and useful information about places to eat, transport and attractions. I speak English, Bulgarian and a little Russian. I honestly think there is plenty to do in Singapore, you can easily pack a week full of activities! My presence at home is somewhat limited due to my job, but I thoroughly enjoy having people over to share their stories and experiences.

We became Airbnb.com hosts back in December 2010.   I was originally an architect, but worked in IT sales/marketing for the next 30+ years.  Semi-retired now,  I still manage consulting projects involving the Internet for small-medium businesses and some community based campaigns to promote better planning outcomes for the whole community, not just developers and their “top end of town” mates.

I call myself an Internet Architect on my business card these days.  Most of my current projects involve marketing using social media tools.

A born and bred Sydneysider, I lived in UK for 10 years till 1984.  I have done lots of travel in Europe, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Japan, New Zealand, USA. 

Studio Yindi incorporates the things we look for when selecting boutique hotels, pensions, hostels and B&Bs for ourselves - space, privacy, wifi Internet access, reading light at the bedside, comfortable and practical for working while ""on the road"", a bit unusual, a little surprise, and value for money. 

My own preferences are for adventure and off the beaten track, rather than luxury, international 5 star. 

We love meeting travellers from all parts of the world, and helping them enjoy the experience of a first visit to Sydney.

We have lots of experience assisting overseas based friends and colleagues to see the best parts of Sydney, using public transport, and avoiding the expensive tourist services.

Messing about on boats is one of my passions. I have a 7.2 m (24') yacht moored nearby on the harbour and know a lot about the nice parts of our extensive waterways, including its part in Australian history.  I love sharing tips on how to see the best of the harbour, using inexpensive public ferries, plus strolls around Cremorne Point from Mosman Bay, or the 3 - 4 hour walk from the Spit to Manly, via Sydney Harbour National Park.

Welcome to Sydney and Kepos Terrace. 

I've lived and studied in Sydney all my life, and I love where I live. 
I'm an artist, so ask me a thousand questions about the Sydney art scene, but watch me blush if your query requires sports knowledge. 

I graduated with an honors degree with National Art School NSW, so there are a few of my paintings around the house, and I am currently working on my next piece.  

I do work full-time, and regularly I attend new shows and gallery openings after work,  and on the weekends I like to have no plans but to simply enjoy being around the house and sometimes having friends over. I am quite busy during the week,  but on the weekends I have more time to sit and talk with  you about my ideas and thoughts about places to go and things to do in Sydney, or even to plan to see events together.     

Regarding pets, I have a lovely cat named Roger, who is friendly and very well mannered. He will come for a pat if encouraged, or he will leave you alone,  (he gets a mention in every review).

I have done some traveling, and in 2009 I traveled through New York with airbnb. 

That's me in a nutshell! 

We look forward to meeting you.

Can't imagine life without friends, good spicy food and the prospect of another travel adventure.  Have backpacked, and travelled in style, kayaked down rivers and even hiked the Kokoda Track sharing a backpack with my boyfriend of the time.  I continue to travel now with perhaps the focus being on catching up with beloved friends all over the world from the days of living and working overseas.
Now prefer softer options along with a good bottle of wine, delicious food of the region wherever, classical music or some great rock.
Age is a state of mind rather than the years lived, and it is good to be able to look backwards and forwards.
I love meeting people through airbnb - different chats over a glass of wine and if the opportunity arises showing them the lesser known beauty of Sydney.",within a day,100%,50%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1305178/profile_pic/1318919879/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1305178/profile_pic/1318919879/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Kirribilli/Milsons Point,3,5,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Kirribilli, New South Wales, Australia",North Sydney,,-33.84357,151.21512,Private room in condo,Private room,1,,1 shared bath,1,1,"[""Washer"", ""Host greets you"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Breakfast"", ""Kitchen"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Bed linens"", ""Wifi"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Stove"", ""Essentials"", ""Dryer"", ""Hot water"", ""Hangers"", ""Single level home"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Heating"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Microwave"", ""Private patio or balcony"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Hair dryer"", ""TV"", ""Oven"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Iron"", ""Refrigerator"", ""BBQ grill"", ""Shampoo"", ""Private garden or backyard""]",$101.00 ,1,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,,t,8,38,68,69,9/9/2022,88,0,0,11/19/2011,1/5/2020,4.87,4.92,4.96,4.95,5,4.96,4.87,PID-STRA-22297,f,2,1,1,0,0.67,Sydney

For over a decade I worked at the Art Gallery of NSW which is a short walk from the apartment. I’d walk into work every day and most days do a quick walk at lunch time around the Botanical Gardens to take in the view of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge.

Welcome to Sydney and Kepos Terrace. 

I've lived and studied in Sydney all my life, and I love where I live. 
I'm an artist, so ask me a thousand questions about the Sydney art scene, but watch me blush if your query requires sports knowledge. 

I graduated with an honors degree with National Art School NSW, so there are a few of my paintings around the house, and I am currently working on my next piece.  

I do work full-time, and regularly I attend new shows and gallery openings after work,  and on the weekends I like to have no plans but to simply enjoy being around the house and sometimes having friends over. I am quite busy during the week,  but on the weekends I have more time to sit and talk with  you about my ideas and thoughts about places to go and things to do in Sydney, or even to plan to see events together.     

Regarding pets, I have a lovely cat named Roger, who is friendly and very well mannered. He will come for a pat if encouraged, or he will leave you alone,  (he gets a mention in every review).

I have done some traveling, and in 2009 I traveled through New York with airbnb. 

That's me in a nutshell!

Hi there! I am a professional, living in Sydney for the past 5 years. It's kinda a given - to be on this site - and profess a love for travelling, but it's true! 

Stepping off a plane onto new ground. Seeing new faces, absorbing smells and sounds of different cultures. The unease of exploring unfamiliar territories. Observing similarities & differences of communities across the world. And the taste sensations of food from local kitchens. All these inspire my constant need for seeing new parts of the world, whenever I can. 

And while I'm in between travel, I enjoy exploring my current home city of Sydney - the culture, night life, arts & music scene, beaches and bush. I thought, since I currently have a spare room, why not open my home to fellow travellers?  By making it available on Airbnb, I can continue to meet new people and experience different cultures via the people travelling through Sydney - best of both worlds indeed.

I like being a Host as I like meeting people and hearing about their lives, stories, dreams and hopes.

*****

We've been busy, building up a collection of lovely historical apartments in Galata, our favourite part of Istanbul. We've personally renovated most of them and stay in them ourselves whenever we can. Recently we've added a sweet flat in the UK's Cotswolds into the mix.

20 years ago we met in Istanbul, Tarkan's home city, while I was there for a photography assignment. Since then we've led international lives together, based in Istanbul, Singapore and now England, my original country. 

Along the way we've raised our son, Eren, across the cultures as we've steadily grown this holiday apartment project, our second baby. We see it as a way to find balance in our family life and to always have a home in our best-loved city.  

We understand from our own experiences, what makes a great city-break stay and we try our very hardest to deliver it to you in Istanbul. For this we've won i-escape's global Guest Award for 'Best City Apartment' two years running and Tripadvisor's Certificate of Excellence 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (2021 isn’t announced yet ;) 

We’re also listed in many guidebooks. 

Your questions and booking will be handled by us. On your arrival our manager Taskin and  friendly team with their natural Turkish hospitality, will welcome you to your apartment, pass over your keys and explain practicalities and the neighborhood. You'll have as much or as little help as you choose and we're sure you'll soon feel at home in the cosmopolitan and very welcoming local community.

Recently I started living alone and decided to let my flat as it is too big for one person & I have another accomodation facility.

I also wish to do this as a hobby too because I need some kind of occupation to fill up a part of my time. 
So I am looking forward to meeting, hosting and helping my guests from abroad.

I live here now with my husband who is an American and two kids. We love living in Istanbul as it is beautiful, fun and culturally very rich. 

After moving back, I started working with my family on a residential renovation project. We renovated a registered historical building and turned it into four rental units and an art gallery.

The building was awarded a LEED silver certificate by the US Green Building Council for its environmentally responsible features.

Julia, Tarkan and manager Taskin are certified by the UK Institute of Hospitality for 'Coronavirus: Taking Proactive Action'. High-touch areas are disinfected with alcohol spray and apartments are cleaned more thoroughly than ever, though we had a great reputation for our cleanliness before too!

*****

We've been busy, building up a collection of lovely historical apartments in Galata, our favourite part of Istanbul. We've personally renovated most of them and stay in them ourselves whenever we can. Recently we've added a sweet flat in the UK's Cotswolds into the mix.

20 years ago we met in Istanbul, Tarkan's home city, while I was there for a photography assignment. Since then we've led international lives together, based in Istanbul, Singapore and now England, my original country. 

Along the way we've raised our son, Eren, across the cultures as we've steadily grown this holiday apartment project, our second baby. We see it as a way to find balance in our family life and to always have a home in our best-loved city.  

We understand from our own experiences, what makes a great city-break stay and we try our very hardest to deliver it to you in Istanbul. For this we've won i-escape's global Guest Award for 'Best City Apartment' two years running and Tripadvisor's Certificate of Excellence 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (2021 isn’t announced yet ;) 

We’re also listed in many guidebooks. 

Your questions and booking will be handled by us. On your arrival our manager Taskin and  friendly team with their natural Turkish hospitality, will welcome you to your apartment, pass over your keys and explain practicalities and the neighborhood. You'll have as much or as little help as you choose and we're sure you'll soon feel at home in the cosmopolitan and very welcoming local community.
